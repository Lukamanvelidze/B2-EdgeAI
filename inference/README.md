Inference of the newly trained global_model.pt

If you executed the trained as per instructed in README.md from train folder, "global_model.pt" (or the name that you have changed to), it should be in the train folder.
And you should move that ".pt" here, rename the file to global_model.pt if its not that name or change the input name in inference.py to it. 

Then run:
```bash
python3 inference.py
```
