# path to the images folder that is used for val
#val: 

# with the current partitioned data part1, 2, 3... and its folder structure
# it is expected that 

# train: path/to/partitioned/data/folder/train
# val: path/to/partitioned/data/folder/val

# I believe that its best to put the partitioned data folder in the same folder as this file 
# then the path will simply be:

#------------------------------------  uncomment the bellow and append the correct path
#train: ./"name of the partition folder"/train

#val: ./"name of the partition folder"/val
